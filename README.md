    encoder makes spectrogram from text and the vocoder makes audio from spectrogram
    both encoder and vocoder require it's own trained model to work 

encoder:
    tacotron2
    github.com/nvidia/tacotron2 (includes waveglow vocoder)
        (create virtual environment named tacotron2)
        git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/nvidia/tacotron2
        cd tacotron2
        -
        pip install torch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0
        (in requirements.txt, delete numpy==1.13.3 and tensorboard==1.15.0)
        pip install -r req* numpy==1.16 numba==0.48 tensorboard==2.5.0
